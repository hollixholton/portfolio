# Holli Holton

I can remember being 10 years old and knowing that I would one day be a graphic designer.  For my whole life I’ve been observing how people communicate information to the world – and more importantly – which fonts they were using.

Every day I am trying to show my 10 year old self what graphic design can really be.
